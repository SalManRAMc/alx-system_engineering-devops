<h1> NETWORKING </h1>

The OSI Model is not an actual tangible thing, it is a concept

So anyways this Model is split into 7 layers, which can be simplified into this
simple analogy I found on reddit

Layer 1 - Physical: The wires connecting all the telephones together in your
neighborhood.

Layer 2 - Data Link: The phone numbers for everyone in your neighborhood

Layer 3 - Network: The address book your mom has with your neighbors names and
their phone numbers.

Layer 4 - Transport: The telephone company.

Layer 5 - Session: The telephone company's equipment that makes the phone ring
when someone calls and ends the call when everyone hangs up the phone.

Layer 6 - Presentation: The telephone in your house.

Layer 7 - Application: The microphone and speaker on the telephone that let you
hear the other person and let them hear you talking.
